# TuSimple Lane Challenge Class Labels

This repository contains the class labels for the lane boundaries of the TuSimple lane detection dataset. You can download the dataset from [https://github.com/TuSimple/tusimple-benchmark/issues/3](here).

## Classes

Each lane boundary in the dataset is annotated using 7 different classes. Lanes that cannot be uniquely identified are annotated as `Unknown`. A hierarchical representation of the classes is shown below. Even if the `Double-dashed-continuous` class has been considered during the annotation process for completeness, there are no examples in the dataset of such class.
